I am a 2nd year medical student at Texas A&M Health (Science Center). I am interested in designing new medical devices that can better serve patient and provider needs.

I have a BS in Chemistry (2017) from The University of Texas at Austin. My significant experience there was in the <a href="https://eberlin.cm.utexas.edu"> Eberlin Research Group</a> from 2016-2018. I worked on the design and implementation of the <a href="https://www.masspecpen.com"> MasSpec Pen</a> as a part of a multidisciplinary team made up of chemists, engineers, and clinicians.  

Currently, my interests are 3D printing, medical models, CT imaging and processing, and patient education. Please see my recent [projects]({% link projects.markdown %}) for more information. Now I am preparing for clerkship rotations in the greater Houston area as well as a dedicated year of research to finish my Masters of Engineering.
